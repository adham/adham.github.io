We describe a novel framework for the discovery of underlying topics of a longitudinal 
collection of scholarly data, and the tracking of their lifetime and popularity over time.
Unlike the social media or news data, as the topic nuances in science result in new 
scientific directions to emerge, a new approach to model the longitudinal literature 
data is using topics which remain identifiable over the course of time. Current studies 
either disregard the time dimension or treat it as an exchangeable covariate when they 
fix the topics over time or do not share the topics over epochs when they model the time 
naturally. We address these issues by adopting a non-parametric Bayesian approach. We 
assume the data is partially exchangeable and divide it into consecutive epochs. Then, 
by fixing the topics in a recurrent Chinese restaurant franchise, we impose a static 
topical structure on the corpus such that the they are shared across epochs and the 
documents within epochs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework 
on a collection of medical literature related to autism spectrum disorder. We collect 
a large corpus of publications and carefully examining two important research issues 
of the domain as case studies. Moreover, we make the results of our experiment and 
the source code of the model, freely available to aid other researchers by analysing 
the results or applying the model to their data collections.
