 Remote sensing is a useful tool for detecting change over time. We introduce a hybrid 
 change-detection method for forest and protected-area vegetation and demonstrate its use 
 with two satellite images of Golestan National Park in northern Iran (1998 and 2010). 
 We report on the advantages and disadvantages of the hybrid method relative to the 
 standard change-detection method. In the proposed hybrid algorithm, the change vector 
 analysis technique was used to determine changes in vegetation. Following this, we used 
 postclassification comparison to determine the nature of the changes observed and their 
 accuracy and to evaluate the effects of different parameters on the performance of the 
 proposed method. We determined 85% accuracy for the proposed hybrid change-detection 
 method, thus demonstrating a method for discovering and assessing environmental threats 
 to natural treasures.
