The autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is increasingly being recognized as a major 
public health issue which affects approximately 0.5-0.6% of the population. 
Promoting the general awareness of the disorder, increasing the engagement 
with the affected individuals and their carers, and understanding the success 
of penetration of the current clinical recommendations in the target communities, 
is crucial in driving research as well as policy. The aim of the present work 
is to investigate if Twitter, as a highly popular platform for information 
exchange, can be used as a data-mining source which could aid in the aforementioned 
challenges. Specifically, using a large data set of harvested tweets, we present 
a series of experiments which examine a range of linguistic and semantic aspects 
of messages posted by individuals interested in ASD. Our findings, the first of 
their nature in the published scientific literature, strongly motivate additional 
research on this topic and present a methodological basis for further work.
