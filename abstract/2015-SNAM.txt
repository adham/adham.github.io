Considering the raising socio-economic burden of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), 
timely and evidence-driven public policy decision-making and communication of the 
latest guidelines pertaining to the treatment and management of the disorder is 
crucial. Yet evidence suggests that policy makers and medical practitioners do 
not always have a good understanding of the practices and relevant beliefs of 
ASD-afflicted individuals’ carers who often follow questionable recommendations 
and adopt advice poorly supported by scientific data. The key goal of the present 
work is to explore the idea that Twitter, as a highly popular platform for information 
exchange, could be used as a data-mining source to learn about the population affected 
by ASD—their behaviour, concerns, needs, etc. To this end, using a large data set 
of over 11 million harvested tweets as the basis for our investigation, we describe 
a series of experiments which examine a range of linguistic and semantic aspects of 
messages posted by individuals interested in ASD. Our findings, the first of their 
nature in the published scientific literature, strongly motivate additional research 
on this topic and present a methodological basis for further work.
