Notwithstanding recent work which has demonstrated the potential of using Twitter 
messages for content-specific data mining and analysis, the depth of such analysis 
is inherently limited by the scarcity of data imposed by the 140 character tweet 
limit. In this paper we describe a novel approach for targeted knowledge exploration 
which uses tweet content analysis as a preliminary step. This step is used to bootstrap 
more sophisticated data collection from directly related but much richer content 
sources. In particular we demonstrate that valuable information can be collected 
by following URLs included in tweets. We automatically extract content from the 
corresponding web pages and treating each web page as a document linked to the 
original tweet show how a temporal topic model based on a hierarchical Dirichlet 
process can be used to track the evolution of a complex topic structure of a 
Twitter community. Using autism-related tweets we demonstrate that our method 
is capable of capturing a much more meaningful picture of information exchange 
than user-chosen hashtags.
