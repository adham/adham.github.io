In this paper we describe a novel framework for discovering the topical content 
of a data corpus, and the tracking of its complex structural changes across 
the temporal dimension. In contrast to previous work our model does not impose a 
prior on the rate at which documents are added to the corpus nor does it adopt the 
Markovian assumption which overly restricts the type of changes that the model can 
capture. Our key technical contribution is a framework based on (i) discretization of 
time into epochs, (ii) epoch-wise topic discovery using a hierarchical Dirichlet 
process-based model, and (iii) a temporal similarity graph which allows for the 
modelling of complex topic changes: emergence and disappearance, evolution, splitting, 
and merging. The power of the proposed framework is demonstrated on two medical 
literature corpora concerned with the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and the metabolic 
syndrome (MetS) – both increasingly important research subjects with significant social 
and healthcare consequences. In addition to the collected ASD and metabolic syndrome 
literature corpora which we made freely available, our contribution also includes 
an extensive empirical analysis of the proposed framework. We describe a detailed 
and careful examination of the effects that our algorithms’s free parameters have on its 
output, and discuss the significance of the findings both in the context of the practical 
application of our algorithm as well as in the context of the existing body of work 
on temporal topic analysis. Our quantitative analysis is followed by several qualitative 
case studies highly relevant to the current research on ASD and MetS, on which our 
algorithm is shown to capture well the actual developments in these fields.
