I am currently a PhD student at [Centre for Pattern Recognition and Data Analytics (PRaDA)](http://www.deakin.edu.au/research/prada), [Deakin University](http://www.deakin.edu.au). 
My work is in Statistical Machine Learning and its application to healthcare data. 
In particular, I study Bayesian nonparametric models and their application in 
modelling online data about Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This involves topic modelling
and dynamic topic modelling of academic literature data and Twitter messages associated with
ASD.

My Supervisors are:

  * [Prof Svetha Venkatesh](http://www.prada-research.net/~svetha/)
  * [Dr Ognjen ArandjeloviÄ‡](https://oa7.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/)
